Easy Install

If you follow these directions, you will have a working and simple development environment that makes it easy to play around with this project.

Some of you have a development environment you’re comfortable with. If you can run this project without the install directions then please do. Not all of these steps may be right for you.

—————————————

Setting Up Your Environment

Download Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Why?: “VSCode” has a simple interface, and an easy way to search for helpful 		extensions inside of VSCode.

After VSCode is installed, open it and click on the Extensions button towards the left side of the screen. The extensions icon looks similar to a square.
Search for the “Dart” extension and click on the option from the Dart Code team and install the extension.

Download Flutter’s SDK
Download the Flutter SDK files you will need to run this project on your computer

Https://flutter.io/get-started/install/

Make a folder named “Projects” on your desktop. Inside of that folder, create another folder called “Development”

Unzip the downloaded Flutter files and place them into the “Projects/Development” folder

Getting Your Simulator

Download Xcode

https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835

Why?: We need Xcode because it is the easiest way to get you an iOS Simulator on your computer screen. It’s important to have a simulator locally because instant feedback when developing is exciting, motivating and critical.

After Xcode is installed, click on Components in the menu bar and download at least one device simulator. I use the iPhone X simulator and recommend it.

Launching The Project

Place the unzipped contents that you’ve downloaded into the “Projects” folder that you created on your desktop
Open the “Projects” folder in VSCode that is located on your desktop 
VSCode will understand that this is a Flutter project and load the Dart code and other functionality.

Press Command+Shift+P, or the Windows equivalent to bring up the VSCode search menu
Type “Flutter Launch Application” and it will detect your iOS simulator and launch it to the simulator homescreen.
Press “F5” on your keyboard to go into Debug Mode. This launches the project onto the simulator for you to interact with.
